couchpotato (2017.03.26-0) stable; urgency=medium

  * upstream update
  * CouchPotato core software is now located in /apps/couchpotato/bin
      so the CouchPotato update mechanism not delete the ReadyNAS app meta/service files.
  * Fixed the system configuration to allow start and stop of the service,
      but no longer allows the restart of the service with in the app (preventing auto updates to fail).
  * Creating additional checks: localapp, service file/status,
      preinst cleanup to help migration, postrm clean up with the new app structure,
